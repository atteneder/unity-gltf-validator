# glTF-Validator for Unity

This package integrates the [glTF-Validator][gltf-validator] CLI tool into Unity.

It allows you validate a glTF file against the 2.0 specification and reports errors, warnings or info messages.

> Note: Currently it's experimental and only works on macOS!

## Install

You need to have [glTF-Validator][gltf-validator] installed at `/usr/local/bin/gltf_validator` (this exact requirement will be removed).
